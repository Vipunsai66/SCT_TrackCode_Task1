🏠 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on key features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. It’s a foundational project in supervised machine learning and real estate data analytics.

📌 Features
Clean and prepare real estate data from a CSV file.
Build and train a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
Evaluate the model with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualize predicted vs actual prices using Matplotlib.
📊 Dataset
The dataset (house_data.csv) includes:

square_feet: Total area of the house
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
price: Selling price of the house
You can expand or replace it with real housing datasets for better accuracy.
